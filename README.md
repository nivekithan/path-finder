# Inspiration

This project was inspired by the [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4t_-NjY_Sg), I have only copied design and idea but 
I have written every single line of code by myself.

# Path finder

A pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points. This application visualizes 
various pathfinding algorithms in action, and more!


# Stack

This SPA created using 
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety and better DX
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) Frontend library to declarative UI
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling
- [Cypress](cypress.io) for test
